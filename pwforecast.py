class PwForecast(object):
    """
    A tool that dynamically sets Powerwall backup reserve percent based on
    solar forecast.

    PwForecast is useful if you have a day/night rate, and the night rate is
    long enough to charge the batteries.

    PwForecast has primarily been designed for use with 'Self Consumption'
    mode, although it can be used in 'Time Based Control' mode with
    unpredictable results.

    A Solcast API Key and at least one Site ID will be needed.

    Args:
        teslapy_session (teslapy.Tesla): The tesla session object.
        solcast_api_key (str): The Solcast API Key.
        solcast_site_ids (dict): A dict of Solcast site ID's, where key is the
            site name and value is the site ID.

    Attributes:
        min_reserve_peak_rate (int): The minimum backup reserve to be set when
            in peak grid rates. Default 20.
        min_reserve_off_peak_rate (int): The minimum backup reserve that can be
            set when in off-peak grid rates. Default 30.
        max_reserve (int): The maximum backup reserve that can be set. If you
            don't like charging your batteries to 100%, you can set this value.
            Default 100.
        timezone (datetime.tzinfo): The tzdata timezone the system sits within.
            Will use timezone from system by default.
        request_timeout (int): The maximum amount of time in seconds to wait
            when sending a request using requests.get. Default 10.
        required_energy_peak_rate (int): The amount of energy required during
            peak rate in Wh. When setting peak mode, PwForecast will determine
            how much solar will be generated. It will then calculate how much
            to fill the batteries based on the remaining energy requirement.
            Default 30000.
        global_retry_limit (int): The number of times the set function should
            try before failing. This is useful if there is a temporary service
            outage. Be careful setting this value too high as solcast has a
            limited number of API calls. Default 5
        global_retry_sleep (int): The time in seconds to sleep before retrying
            if an error occurs. Default 20.
        set_backup_reserve_retry_limit (int): The number of retries to make
            when setting reserve percent. A failure is defined as an
            unsuccessful switch transition by monitoring the power flow, even
            if the tesla API returns success. Default 5.
        set_backup_reserve_response_sleep (int): The time in seconds to sleep
            before testing the current site power flow. This is useful as the
            Powerwall sometimes takes time to respond to requests. Default 20.
        reserve_switch_margin (int): The minimum number of watts to satisfy a
            successful backup reserve power flow transition (e.g. from
            discharging to charging). When setting the backup reserve higher
            than the current charge, the battery needs to be importing more
            than this value. When setting the backup reserve lower than the
            current charge, the sum of battery+solar needs to be producing more
            than this value. Default 100.
        charge_margin (int): If the Powerwall current charge level is within
            this margin to the value being set, the reserve_switch_margin is
            not monitored. This is necessary because the Powerwall can have
            unexpected behaviour when setting percentages close to current
            charge percentage. There have been cases where the Powerwall has
            started charging when setting a backup reserve 0.7% less than
            current charge percentage, causing the reserve switch checking
            logic to fail. Default 1.
        full_pack_energy (int): The full pack energy in Wh of a brand-new
            Powerwall. This is used to calculate the overall state of health of
            all batteries in the system. Default 14000.
        visible_pack_energy (float): Visible pack energy to take into account
            when calculating a charge percentage for peak rate. This is
            required because the app hides the bottom 5% of available energy.
            When the battery is at 5%, the app shows 0%. Default 0.95.
        discharge_efficiency (float): The efficiency loss to take into account
            when calculating how much energy is needed for peak rate. According
            to the Powerwall specs, it has an overall charge/discharge
            efficiency of 90%. We therefore assume a discharge efficiency of
            95%. Default 0.95.
